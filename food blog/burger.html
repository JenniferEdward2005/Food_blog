        . Prepare the patties:
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce (if using).
Mix the ingredients gently; donâ€™t overwork the meat, or the burgers might become tough.
Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions (for 1/4-pound burgers). Shape each portion into a patty that's about 3/4 inch thick. Make a small indent in the center of each patty with your thumb (this helps them cook evenly and prevents puffing up during cooking).
2. Cook the patties:
Pan-frying: Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and add a little oil. Once hot, add the patties and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare to medium doneness. Adjust the time depending on how well-done you prefer your burger.
Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat and cook the patties for 3-4 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty to melt.
3. Toast the buns:
While the patties are cooking, toast the burger buns. You can do this on a grill or in a pan with a bit of butter until golden brown.
4. Assemble the burger:
Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of the toasted bun.
Add the cooked patty with melted cheese.
Layer with sliced tomatoes, onions, pickles, and your favorite condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.).
Top with the other half of the bun
