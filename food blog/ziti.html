        Cook the pasta: Cook the ziti pasta according to the package directions, usually for about 8-10 minutes, until al dente. Drain and set aside.

Prepare the sauce: In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute until fragrant.

Add the marinara sauce: Pour in the marinara sauce and add the dried basil, oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

Mix the pasta and sauce: Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to combine, making sure the pasta is coated with the sauce.

Assemble the baked ziti: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large baking dish (about 9x13 inches), spread a thin layer of the sauce mixture on the bottom. Then, layer half of the pasta and sauce mixture, followed by a layer of ricotta cheese (dollop it in spoonfuls). Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese and half of the Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat with the remaining pasta, ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.

Bake: Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 20-25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.

Serve: Let the ziti cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil if desired.
